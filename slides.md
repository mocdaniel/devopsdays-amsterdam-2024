# Running as Coping Mechanism

## 1. See Wall 🧱

<br />

## 2. Start Running 🏃

<br />

## 3. ???

<br />

## 4. Crisis averted 😮‍💨

# Running as ~~Coping Mechanism~~ Strategy

## 1. See Wall 🧱

<br />

- Why/Where am I hesitating?
- What is making me nervous?

<style>
  h1 {
    margin-bottom: 4rem;
  }

  ul {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
</style>

# Running as ~~Coping Mechanism~~ Strategy

## 2. Start Running 🏃

<br />

- Stop overthinking!
- Just start!

<style>
  h1 {
    margin-bottom: 4rem;
  }

  ul {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
</style>

---
layout: default
---

# Running as ~~Coping Mechanism~~ Strategy

## 3. ???

<br />

- Keep running!
- Focus on the challenge/process/task at hand!

<style>
  h1 {
    margin-bottom: 4rem;
  }

  ul {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }
</style>

# Running as ~~Coping Mechanism~~ Strategy

## 4. ~~Crisis averted~~ Challenge conquered 😮‍💨

<br />

- Often, we're the only thing blocking ourselves
- 'Starting to run' might be all that's needed to 'unblock' ourselves

<style>
  h1 {
    margin-bottom: 4rem;
  }

  ul {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }

# Summing it up...

- Walls are inevitable in life
- Don't get slowed down by them
- Instead, take action and run a bit 😉

  ul {
    margin-top: 2rem;
